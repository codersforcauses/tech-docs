# Tech Docs

## Why?

As a student-run club, committee rotates out new members every year. As committee members leave, a wealth of knowledge is lost -- especially technical knowledge. This can lead to the same mistakes being repeated year after year. I hope that this documentation will serve as a place for committee members to pass down their knowledge for things like running workshops and projects.
