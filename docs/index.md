# Coders for Causes Tech Docs

A place for CFC committee to pass down their knowledge for all things technical. It is mostly intended to be read by the tech lead of the committee (or project), but everyone should read it! Please do not take the things written here as gospel. These are just the experiences of past committee. Think critically and adapt to the times, but recognise the past!
