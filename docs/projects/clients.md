# Determining Clients

Consider the (unlikely) scenario that we have a number of prospective clients to choose from for a project period. Which projects do you take? Whilst the early stages are mostly in the domain of the President/VP/Secretary, technical input quickly becomes necessary.

## Prospective Client Guide

See the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/codersforcauses/Prospective-Client-Guide-2809c15b755348ccb804d9d175482c02) for evaluating a client.

Being a good tech lead is not just about being the leetiest coder in the group, you **must** be able to communicate your thoughts too! When speaking to clients, you take on the role of an advisor -- your job is to take in the lumps of information that the client provides, and turn it into a clearly-defined structure. When sitting in a client meeting, ask yourself:

- Is what they want realistic?
- Would referring them to an existing service be better?
- Do we have the knowledge?
- Do we have the time?
- How flexible is the client?

Don't be afraid to say no to the client! If you think something is difficult to implement, you need to explain why in a simple manner.
