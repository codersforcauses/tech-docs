# During Projects

See the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/codersforcauses/Volunteering-Guide-7cb4cfa3acef4699ab595b01d482fc47) for managing project volunteers.

You've got a rough plan, and the projects have started. I like to think of this stage as a marathon because your goal is to maintain pace (or velocity in the agile world :rolling_eyes:). This means:

1. Stalk your inbox for new PRs and review them as soon as possible. We don't want volunteers to feel limited and lose interest.
2. Monitor the progress of issues. Make new ones when needed. This is where the planning comes in. The more planning you've done the less you need to think about what's next. Most projects typically follow the same progression of things to do. So if in doubt, you can simply look at past projects for ideas.
3. Have your regular client meetings. Update them on your progress. And once again, don't

## Engagement

Prizes work surprisingly well.
