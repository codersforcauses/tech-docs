# Running Existing Workshops

By nature of operating out of a Uni, a lot of things can be reused. For example, the Uni still refuses to teach Git in first year, so it's often a great starter workshop to the new year. A good majority of them are on the [workshops](https://workshops.codersforcauses.org/) site.

## Presentations

Most workshops come with a presentation to formally introduce attendees to the topic. They're usually in the Canva and sometimes Google Drive. Good luck...

## Repo Templates

Some workshop activities (like the Git one) have a GitHub repo template to make it easier to set up stuff. You can find them on our [GitHub](https://github.com/codersforcauses/). If a workshop doesn't have an activity already, please make one!

## Update the Workshops site

You can simply copy the workshop and paste it into a new section (e.g. Summer 2024/2025), then update the `mkdocs.yml`.
