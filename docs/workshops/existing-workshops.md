# Running Existing Workshops

By nature of operating out of a Uni, a lot of things can be reused. For example, the Uni still refuses to teach Git in first year, so it's often a great starter workshop to the new year. A good majority of them are on the [workshops](https://workshops.codersforcauses.org/) site.
